Problem Statement: Develop a database for a Library Management System
About the Project
We created this database system to help library systems keep track of their books, memebers, and transactions. Our system makes it easy to see which books are available, track memeber history, and analyze transactions patterns.

Virtual Database
For this project, we set up a virtual database using MySQL Command Line Client. We chose this approach because:

It gave us a safe environment to test all our SQL queries without any risk
We could easily reset the database when needed during development
Everyone in our group could work with the same database structure
It's perfect for demonstrating how the system works during evaluation
The MySQL Command Line Client let us directly execute our queries and see results immediately, which made development and testing much faster.

Our Database Structure
We kept the database simple with three main tables:

 Books (BookID, Title, Author, Genre, Availability)
 
 Members (MemberID, Name, Contact, MembershipDate)

Transactions (TransactionID, MemberID, BookID, BorrowDate, ReturnDate)

Getting Started
If you want to test our system:

# Open MySQL Command Line Client
mysql -u username -p

# Set up the database
CREATE DATABASE library_management;
USE library_management;

# Run our scripts
source SQL_Scripts/create_tables.sql
source SQL_Scripts/insert_data.sql
source SQL_Scripts/queries.sql
Key Features (Implemented as Queries)
We implemented all these features as SQL queries:

Note
This is our submission for the DBMS course project. We've implemented everything using MySQL Command Line Client as our virtual database environment.
